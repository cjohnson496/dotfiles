# Sample .profile
# Redone by Charles Johnson
# This file is read each time a login shell is started.
# All other interactive shells will only read .bashrc; this is particularly
# important for language settings, see below.

[[ -s "$HOME/.bashrc" ]] && source "$HOME/.bashrc" # Load the default .profile
